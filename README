## a. What is AMQP?

AMQP stands for **Advanced Message Queuing Protocol**. It is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. AMQP defines rules for how messages are formatted, routed, and delivered between producers and consumers in distributed systems. The protocol ensures reliable and interoperable communication by providing features like message acknowledgement, queueing, and transaction support. Many popular message brokers, such as RabbitMQ, implement AMQP to enable asynchronous, decoupled communication between services.

## b. Meaning of `guest:guest@localhost:5672`

The URI `guest:guest@localhost:5672` is a connection string used by AMQP clients to connect to a message broker. The first `guest` is the **username** for authenticating with the broker. The second `guest` is the **password** corresponding to that user account. `localhost` specifies that the broker is running on the **same machine** (the local host) as the client application. Finally, `5672` is the **default TCP port** on which the AMQP broker listens for incoming connections.
